AI tools remember only limited information at once, and input quality matters significantly. I'll explain context engineering and demonstrate practical techniques for managing context windows. We'll explore what consumes context, how to monitor it, and when to clear it. While I'll use Claude.ai and Claude Code for demonstrations, the principles apply broadly to similar tools.
